        <h1> FrondFinder! </h1>
        <h2> The only website where you can search for friends who like similar houseplants! </h2>
        <h4>This is an exceedingly useful function: after all, Houseplants are an important part of our lives, 
            and there are few metrics more telling to the compatibility of two humans among each other than the true,
            deeply-forged bond between two individuals who both enjoy sedum sempervidum. 
        </h4>
        <h6>Let me note that I cannot guarantee that such a bond will be created between you and your plant-buddy. 
            Bonds among plant-buddies are like true love: forged in adversity and created by more complex means than algorithms.
            Thus, do not be disappointed if your plant-buddy does not fulfill all your hopes and dreams at first glance.
